You can walk everywhere... for coffee, for groceries, for a night out, for breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.","What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases. And if you leave the pillows behind, they'll be donated to a local women's shelter that ","Convenient bus stops are just down the block, if you're headed downtown or further afield to explore.

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

Belltown is also an easy walk, just on the other side of Seattle Center - I walk to work in Belltown and it usually takes me about 25 minutes.

They're usually less expensive than taxis, but you'll need to download the apps to your smartphone in order to use them. You can get your first ride for free up to $20 by using the code uvgmm for Uber or libby111 for Lyft! Bus: There are bus stops all over - the closest ones are less than 5 mins walking. The cost is $2.50, cash only. Monorail/Light Rail: The monorail at the Space Needle is 15 mins walking, and that will take you to 5th x Pine downtown for $2 (cash only). From there you can cross the street to the light rail station for quick and cheap access to the stadiums, Amtrak station, and airport. The light rail kiosks accept both cash and credit cards. Bike: Seattle now has a bike share program called Pronto. 24 hour passes are $8, and 3-day passes are $16.

You can walk everywhere... for coffee, for groceries, for a night out, for breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.","What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.
