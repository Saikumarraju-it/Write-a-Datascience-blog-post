# Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post on Seattle-Airbnb-Listings

### Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

### Data
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset: 
  * Listings, including full descriptions and average review score  
  * Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments  
  * Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

### Goal -- analyze the following question
“What are the most common amenities in the listings?”
“What attracts the guests most for renting a property?”
“What are the most significant features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?”
“What are the Top positive and negative impacted features to predict price?”
